## Thanks
First, I want to thank the members of the Tinker's Union for helping with creating this pack.  Also I would like to thank Xisuma and his team for creating the mob heads used in 1.12.  Their work was used as a basis for this pack.  

And Xisuma, if you're out there and get wind of this pack, I would be honored to hear from you.  :)
